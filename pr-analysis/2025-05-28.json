It adds a new file for template8 and updates the index to include this new template in the TEMPLATE_FN_MAP. The new template provides a schematic layout for a chip with specific pin configurations and labels, which can be used in building circuits.",

The changes include new files for the template and visualization components, as well as modifications to existing files to integrate these features. The visualization allows users to interactively view connections between components in a circuit, enhancing the usability and functionality of the schematic match adapt tool.",

    "description": "This pull request breaks up the adaptation process into multiple solvers, allowing for independent adaptation of matched templates. It also introduces functionality to display the output of the circuit in SVG format after layout has been applied, and fixes issues related to applying layouts to circuit JSON, ensuring that proper net labels are included. The changes enhance the modularity and usability of the adaptation process, making it easier to manage and visualize circuit layouts.",
