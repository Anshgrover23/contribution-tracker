# contribution-tracker

Generates weekly contribution overviews for tscircuit contributors. Check out all
the [contribution overviews here](./contribution-overviews/)

* All PRs in the tscircuit org are scanned/summarized via Claude Haiku
* Claude classifies each Diff/PR as a Major, Minor or Tiny contribution
* All the PRs, summaries, and classifications are organized into charts and tables

The current week is shown below. There are 3 major sections:

* [Contributor Overview](#contributor-overview)
* [PRs by Repository](#prs-by-repository)
* [PRs by Contributor](#changes-by-contributor)
